# spinsfast
Fast and exact spin-s spherical-harmonic transforms

This code is a lightly modified version of the code hosted [here](http://astrophysics.physics.fsu.edu/~huffenbe/research/spinsfast/index.html) by Huffenberger, based on work by [Huffenberger and Wandelt](http://stacks.iop.org/0067-0049/189/255).  My modifications are basically to make it easier to install as a python module.
